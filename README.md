# landing-page
At the end of the of The Odin Projects' Flexbox foundation lesson, the landing page assignment was given.
I used the lessons I learned over the past month on HTML, CSS, and Flexbox to do this project.
It took me quite a while to do this because I was stuck on diffrent concepts such as the navbar and application of flexbox.
On December 9, 2021, I finished it successfully.
The landing page was about one of my favourite YA book series, The Mortal Instruments by Cassandra Clare.
I have learned significantly from this project and I am excited for the next step. JavaScript!
